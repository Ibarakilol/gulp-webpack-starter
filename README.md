# Production-ready Gulp/Webpack starter
## How to use
* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (if required)
* Install ```gulp``` and ```yarn``` globally: ```npm i -g gulp yarn```
* Download repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): ```git clone https://github.com/Ibarakilol/gulp-webpack-starter.git```
* Navigate to the downloaded folder
* Download the required dependencies: ```yarn```
* To begin, enter the command: ```yarn dev```
