# Production-ready Gulp/Webpack starter
## How to use
1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) (if required)
2. Install ```gulp``` and ```yarn``` globally: ```npm i -g gulp yarn```
3. Download repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): ```git clone https://github.com/Ibarakilol/gulp-webpack-starter.git```
4. Navigate to the downloaded folder
5. Download the required dependencies: ```yarn```
6. To begin, enter the command: ```yarn dev```
7. To build the project, enter the command ```yarn build```

If you did everything correctly, you should open a browser with a local server. Build mode involves optimizing the project: compressing images, minifying CSS and JS files for uploading to the server.
